search_civievent
================

A `Joomla!` component to search for and return CiviCRM's events (CiviEvent) via a component similar to and based on Joomla's com_search.


This clone of sorts of the Joomla! com_search component that searches only events using a MODIFIED version of the  [CiviCRM-Search-Plugin](https://github.com/lcdservices/CiviCRM-Search-Plugin) plugin.   That MODIFIED version of the plugin must be installed FIRST.  (That needs to be forked and a reference to that fork needs to go here).



###WHAT WORKS (or should):
  - [x] should install and uninstall cleanly
  - [x] will pick up event start dates and display below the title in the results with formatting via PHP date format strings
  - [x] filters added for filtering by future and past


###BUGS, ENHANCEMENT WISH LIST:
- see repo in github
